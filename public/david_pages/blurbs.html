  “Don’t Shoot will do for the fight against violence what Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring did for the environmental movement a generation ago.”

  “The good news about the drug- and gang-related violence epidemic is that it can be controlled and substantially reduced. As proof, you only have to read David Kennedy’s wonderful new book Don’t Shoot. It chronicles his ideas and crusade to bring police and communities together in partnerships to successfully deal with the cancer of drug-related crime and violence that has ravaged those communities and demoralized the police. Now being tried in over 70 communities, David’s campaign is expanding to have the national and international impact it deserves.”

  “Don't Shoot is a work of moral philosophy that reads like a crime novel—Immanuel Kant meets Joseph Wambaugh. It’s a fascinating, inspiring, and wonderfully well written story of one man's quest to solve a problem no one thought could be solved: the scourge of inner city gang violence. We had tried arresting these young men, incarcerating them, and outgunning them, always without lasting success, but what had never been tried before David Kennedy and his colleagues began piecing together their methodology was the simplest and yet most radical approach imaginable: listening to them, and harnessing the greatest force of all—the moral authority of their peers. This is a vitally important work that has the potential to usher in a new era in policing.”

  “Don’t Shoot, based on David Kennedy’s fresh re-reading of criminology, his time on the ground with police, gangs, and families, and his indignation with the slaughter of young  black men, brings together what is truly one of a small number of ‘big ideas’ revolutionizing crime control, especially policing and prosecution.  Shame on any city, police department, or prosecutor’s office that isn’t learning from his experience. What Don’t Shoot documents really matters.”

  “David M. Kennedy’s latest work is an invitation to the future of urban policing. In these pages is a dynamic exploration of racial reconciliation, stakeholder partnerships, and mass incarceration alternatives as key components of crime reduction. Kennedy’s ideas extend beyond community policing and serve to revolutionize the entire criminal justice system.”

  “Despite the recent and welcome decline in United States crime, gun crime remains a persistent concern in this country. Solutions to the ‘gun problem,’ fueled by ideological, constitutional, and moral debates, diverge considerably.  In Don’t Shoot, David Kennedy elegantly and forcefully describes an approach to stopping gun violence that does not depend on policing gun crime with guns or solving crime’s root causes.  Instead, his approach leans on the power of community trust in the law and officials – legitimacy.  Offenders can and do voluntarily comply with the law. When they do, neighborhoods are safer, fewer people go to prison, and policing is turned on its head.”

   “David Kennedy’s work helped Cincinnati revolutionize the way that we think about policing our community.  His passion for solving the never-ending cycle of violence is evident in every conversation with him.  We have found that by engaging offenders with a strong, unified, community message telling them that the violence must stop and offering them an alternative life, we can have a meaningful and lasting impact in our community.  David’s work is a must read for Mayors around the country confronted with the scourge of gun violence in their cities.”

  “The author brings more than two decades of practical, administrative, managerial, supervisory and academic experience to this work of art.  A unique and comprehensive view of the toxic impact of mass incarceration on our most vulnerable neighborhoods as seen through the eyes of this criminal justice professional. A must read.”

   “The book provides a raw and unadulterated look at gang violence as well as Mr. Kennedy’s approach to combating it on a national level…  His commitment over the years has helped to save and change the lives of many youth… This is a must read for all!”

  “The subheading for this book, ‘The End of Violence in Inner-City America’ would be pretentious if were it not for the indisputable evidence, compelling true stories, and common sense solutions detailed therein.  Bottom line: this works.”
