    %h3 What is Rubeco?
    %p Rubeco is an application that enables a community to participate in managing and organizing content around the Ruby and Ruby on Rails technology ecosystems. Rubeco is an implementation of a project called Ecosystem designed to help people store, reference, and learn from information about a particular knowledge ecosystem. At the lowest level, Ecosystem organizes information based on two fundamental structures:
    %h4= link_to 'Nodes', nodes_path, :class => 'bold loud'
    %p Nodes are used to represent a specific topic, subject, or tool. A Node can be linked to other nodes via explicitly defined Relationships. The node holds basic details as well as resources helpful in learning that node.
    %h4= link_to 'Relationships', relationships_path, :class => 'bold loud'
    %p Relationships are used to link nodes to one another when two (or more) nodes share a contextual relationship. The specific context of the Relationship is captured in the Relationship's sentences, one for each direction of the relationship, after all, how A relates to B is of often different than how B relates to A.

    %h3 Contribute
    %h4 Community Content
    %p
      =link_to 'Sign up', new_user_registration_path, :class => 'quiet'
      now and start adding content. Start with links that help you learn something, teach any "aha" moments with short tutorials, or share your expert knowledge in an extensive how-to.  The more you interact, the more you'll discover.
    %h4 Code
    %p
      Help Ecosystem get better. It is still very much a work in progress and the more help the better. If you come across an issue, log it on the github 
      =link_to('issue tracker', 'https://github.com/gmassanek/ecosystem/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open', :class => 'quiet') + "."
