This is a project to visually represent a computing ecosystem, in particular the Ruby and Ruby on Rails ecosystems.  As an up and comer, I have found it difficult to find a place to find out about the different tools available to a rails developer.  In my quest to learn all these tools, I am planning to make a site that explains all these tools and encourages exploration and experimentation.
